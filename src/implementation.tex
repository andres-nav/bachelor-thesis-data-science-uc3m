\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}

Following the design presented in the previous \cref{ch:design}, this chapter lays out the implementation of the system and the integration of the components that compose it, as well as the methodologies and tools used to develop, assemble, and integrate the system. As previously explained, the system is divided into four main components: the \gls{uav}, the control station, and the reconnaissance platform. Each component is implemented separately and then integrated into the system as a whole following the V-model methodology described in \cref{ch:methodology_approach}.
