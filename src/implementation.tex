\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}

Following the design presented in the previous chapter, this chapter lays out the implementation of the system and the integration of the components that compose it, as well as the methodologies and tools used to develop, assemble, and integrate the system. As stated in the design chapter, refer to \cref{ch:design}, the system is divided into four main components: the \gls{uav}, the ground station, the reconnaissance platform, and the communication system. Each component is implemented separately and then integrated into the system as a whole.
