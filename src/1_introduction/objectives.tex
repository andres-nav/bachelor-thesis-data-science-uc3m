The main goal of this thesis is to develop a open-source, modular and customizable drone that can be used in remote areas. The drone will be able to fly autonomously and will be able to communicate with a ground station. The drone will be able to be controlled remotely and will be able to be programmed to perform specific tasks. The drone will be able to be used in a variety of applications, such as reconnaissance, surveillance, agriculture, humanitarian aid, etc.

Moreover, a software platform will be developed that will allow the drone to be programmed to perform reconnaissance tasks and the software will be designed to support multiple drones to create a swarm of drones that can be used to perform reconnaissance tasks in a coordinated way.

The drone will be designed to be easy to assemble and disassemble and will be designed to be easy to repair and maintain. The drone will be designed to be cheap and will be designed to be easy to customize and modify.
