\chapter{Statement of the problem}

primary problem: the use of autonomous drones for remote areas is not widespread due to the lack of infrastructures, software and cheap drones.

moreover, the lack of specific knowledge and the steps to create a drone from scratch is a high barrier of entry for many people.

exisitng solutions as the dji drones are expensive and not open source, and not customizable which limits the potential of the drones. moreover the modularity of the drones is limited so the applicaitons are just a subset of the potential applications for example reconnaissance, surveillance, agriculture, etc.

Moreover, working in remote areas is often not possible due to the lack of infrasturctures, such as roads, electricity, internet, etc. This makes it difficult to use drones in these areas.

as this problem is broad, it needs to be narrowed down to a specific problem that can be solved in this thesis. The environment that will be modeled in this thesis will have the following characteristics:
