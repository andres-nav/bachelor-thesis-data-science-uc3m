\chapter{Objectives}\label{ch:objectives}

The main objective of this thesis is to offer the research community an open-source, cost-effective solution for deploying drones in remote environments to support the study of \glspl{ntn}. This project specifically aims to foster new research in the field of \glspl{ntn} and low-altitude, drone-based networks, providing a platform for further exploration of drone applications in remote areas.

Additionally, the project seeks to develop a reconnaissance platform capable of scouting and detecting individuals, establishing a practical foundation for drone use in applications such as humanitarian aid, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, thereby contributing to public safety and well-being.

To meet these objectives, the following specific goals have been set:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Design a modular, customizable drone, enabling easy modifications for different applications.

  \item Use off-the-shelf components for easy assembly, repair, and maintenance.

  \item Ensure the drone supports autonomous flight, essential for operating in remote areas where manual control is difficult.

  \item Integrate the latest advancements in drone technology to remain competitive while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

  \item Develop a customizable reconnaissance platform that can integrate different sensors to gather environmental data and adapt to various tasks.

  \item Enable real-time data processing and analysis on the reconnaissance platform, providing actionable insights for diverse applications.
\end{itemize}
