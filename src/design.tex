\chapter{Design}\label{ch:design}

This chapter outlines the system's design, detailing its components in accordance with the requirements specified in \cref{ch:requirements}. The system consists of four core components: the \gls{uav}, responsible for reconnaissance tasks; the ground station, which oversees real-time monitoring of the \gls{uav}; the reconnaissance platform, tasked with processing data from the \gls{uav} and delivering actionable insights; and the communication system, enabling real-time data exchange between the \gls{uav}, ground station, and the reconnaissance platform.
