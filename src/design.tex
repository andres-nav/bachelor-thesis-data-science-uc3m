\chapter{Design}\label{ch:design}

This chapter presents the design of the system and the components that compose it according to the requirements defined in the \cref{ch:requirements}. The system is divided into three main components: the \gls{uav}, which is the drone that performs the reconnaissance tasks, the ground station, which is the control station that monitors the \gls{uav} in real-time, the reconnaissance platform, which is the system that processes the data collected by the \gls{uav} and provides insights to the end-user, and the communication system, which is the system that allows the \gls{uav} to communicate with the ground station in real-time and also provides the connection to the reconnaissance platform.
