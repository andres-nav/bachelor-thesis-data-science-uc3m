\chapter{Design}\label{ch:design}

This chapter outlines the system's design, detailing its components in accordance with the requirements specified in \cref{ch:requirements}. The system consists of four core components: the \gls{uav}, responsible for providing the functionality and mobility, the control station, responsible for monitoring the \gls{uav} in real-time and updating its flight plan, the communication system, responsible for enabling real-time data exchange between the \gls{uav}, control station, and reconnaissance platform, and the reconnaissance platform, responsible for processing the data collected by the \gls{uav} and providing insights to the end-user.
